ðŸŽ² Dice Game A simple JavaScript dice game where two players roll dice automatically upon refreshing the page. The player with the highest dice roll wins! This project helped me practice DOM manipulation and randomization in JavaScript. 

This is a simple dice game built using JavaScript as part of my learning journey. The game features:
- Two players, each represented by a dice.
- Automatic dice roll when the page is refreshed.
- Randomized results using Math.random() to simulate a dice roll.
- A winner announcement based on the higher dice value.
  
This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, functions, and conditional logic in JavaScript.
